### Campaign Lifecycle

```clarity
;; Create new campaign
(contract-call? .crowd_funding create-campaign
    u1000000000  ;; 1000 STX goal
    u1000)       ;; 1000 blocks deadline

;; Contribute to campaign
(contract-call? .crowd_funding contribute u0 u50000000) ;; Campaign 0, 50 STX

;; Claim funds (owner only, after deadline, if goal met)
(contract-call? .crowd_funding claim-funds u0)

;; Request refund (if campaign failed)
(contract-call? .crowd_funding refund u0)
```

### Milestone Management

```clarity
;; Add project milestone
(contract-call? .crowd_funding add-campaign-milestone
    u0                           ;; campaign-id
    u"Phase 1 Complete"         ;; title
    u"MVP development finished" ;; description
    u250000000                  ;; 250 STX target
    u500)                       ;; deadline

;; Post campaign update
(contract-call? .crowd_funding post-campaign-update
    u0                          ;; campaign-id
    u"Development Progress"     ;; title
    u"50% complete, on schedule") ;; content
```

### Platform Administration

```clarity
;; Update platform fee (owner only)
(contract-call? .crowd_funding update-platform-fee u50) ;; 0.5%

;; Update minimum contribution (owner only)
(contract-call? .crowd_funding update-minimum-contribution u5000000) ;; 5 STX

;; Report campaign (owner only)
(contract-call? .crowd_funding report-campaign u0 u"Suspicious activity")
```

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Data Structures

#### Campaign Map

```clarity
campaigns: {
    owner: principal,
    goal: uint,
    raised: uint,
    deadline: uint,
    claimed: bool
}
```

#### Contribution Tracking

```clarity
contributions: {
    campaign-id: uint,
    contributor: principal
} -> {
    amount: uint
}
```

#### Milestone System

```clarity
campaign-milestones: {
    campaign-id: uint,
    milestone-id: uint
} -> {
    title: string-utf8,
    description: string-utf8,
    target-amount: uint,
    completed: bool,
    deadline: uint
}
```
